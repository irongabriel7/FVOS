FVOS â€” Fingerprint Voting Online System
Fingerprint Voting Online System (FVOS) is an innovative application designed to modernize the voting process using biometric authentication. It utilizes voter fingerprint data linked to Aadhaar for secure identification, ensuring transparency and eliminating duplicate or fraudulent votes. All votes are stored securely on a remote server to provide fast, reliable, and tamper-proof election results.
